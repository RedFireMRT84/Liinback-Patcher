This is a source code of the Liinback Patcher for the Nintendo Wii I made. 
All this code does is download the already patched WAD from the atspace server and sets the WAD region to free.
For Windows users, you can search for the "freethewads" executable on mariocube.com at "Wii" and "PC Applications". Make sure you extract the archive onto ur directory of this source code.
