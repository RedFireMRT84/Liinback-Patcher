This is a source code of the Liinback Patcher for the Nintendo Wii I made. 
All this code does is download the already patched WAD from the atspace server and sets the WAD region to free.
For Windows users, you can search for the "freethewads" executable on mariocube.com at "Wii" and "PC Applications". Make sure you extract the archive onto your directory of this source code.
UPDATE:
I'm sorry, but I gotta admit, that the Liinback public instance, which means the public beta here, no longer works. So if that's case, I might as well just only open the Liinback patcher source code and close the releases, and also remove the WADs as well from my repository.
